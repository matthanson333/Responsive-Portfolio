# Responsive-Portfolio

In this project, I was tasked with creating a responsive portfolio, consisting of index, portfolio, and contact pages. These pages should all be linked through a continuous navbar, with responsive content - including imaging.

Using Bootstrap framework, I created a functional and deployed application with functional navigation and responsive content, utilizing the Bootstrap grid system. It has been validating through an HTML validation service, and deployed through Github.
